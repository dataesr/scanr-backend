Means of braking release eject the floating element towards the surface with a preprogrammed braking after detection of one or more characteristic parameters of the vessel being sunk, for example a shock of a given violence or a minimum hydrostatic pressure. A sonar receiver starts the ejection on receipt of a sonar signal and a telecontrol starts the pump. The pump is on rails, so it can slide by gravity from a high position to a low one.

A heating conducting track is placed on the pyrotechnic charge and is only in contact with the charge. The chamber contains a hollow cavity in the support and the pyrotechnic charge is in the form of a film coating this cavity, or as a coating for a heating conducting wire (5) crossing the chamber. The wire has a diameter of between 10 and 100 mu m. The flexible membrane can inflate or unfold as the gases from the charge expand and it is made of Teflon.

The subscans of the first type address two adjacent rows of the panel simultaneously and the subscans of the second type address each row of cells of the panel individually. In certain cases, the grey level delivered to the cells is modified before display. For two neighbouring cells sharing the same subscans of the second type and displaying the grey levels A and B, one of the grey levels, A or B, is modified if the first subscan for which one of the cells changes state is a subscan of the first type.","publicationDate":"2003","type":"PATENT","link":"http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?II=3&ND=3&adjacent=true&locale=fr_EP&FT=D&CC=FR&NR=2826767A1","source":null,"subtitle":null,"alternativeSummary":null,"linkDocument":null,"authors":null,"thesisDirectors":null,"identifiers":{"thesesfr":null,"patent":"FR-2826767"},"thematics":[{"type":"cib_35","code":"02","label":"Audiovisuel"},{"type":"cib_5","code":"D1","label":"Electronique, électricité"},{"type":"cib_sde1","code":"DE_sA3","label":"Ordinateurs, machines de bureau"},{"type":"cib_de","code":"DE_A","label":"TIC"}],"structures":["383461191"]},{"id":"0108839","title":"SYSTEME DE PASSERELLE ENTRE UNE PLATE-FORME ET UN MODULE LOGICIEL EXTERNE","summary":"In order to enable communication between a platform (PF) and an external software module (MLE) which is developed independently from said platform, a server agent (AS) is installed on said platform (PF) and dialogs with the external software module (MLE) in order to dynamically generate a proxy agent (AS) as a gateway upon request from said module, said proxy agent being defined according to parameters (CAP, ACAP) which are communicated by the software module so that it can be equivalent, via said gateway, to an agent deployed on said platform.","publicationDate":"2003","type":"PATENT","link":"http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?II=3&ND=3&adjacent=true&locale=fr_EP&FT=D&CC=FR&NR=2826750A1","source":null,"subtitle":null,"alternativeSummary":null,"linkDocument":null,"authors":null,"thesisDirectors":null,"identifiers":{"thesesfr":null,"patent":"FR-2826750"},"thematics":[{"type":"cib_35","code":"04","label":"Transmission d’informations numériques"},{"type":"cib_35","code":"06","label":"Techniques d’informatique"},{"type":"cib_5","code":"D1","label":"Electronique, électricité"},{"type":"cib_sde1","code":"DE_sA1","label":"Télécommunications"},{"type":"cib_sde1","code":"DE_sA3","label":"Ordinateurs, machines de bureau"},{"type":"cib_de","code":"DE_A","label":"TIC"},{"type":"cib_de","code":"DE_A","label":"TIC"}],"structures":["380129866"]},{"id":"0108840","title":"CONTACT ELECTRIQUE FEMELLE","summary":"The invention concerns a single-piece folded cut out female electric contact (1) comprising longitudinally a rear zone to be connected to an electric conductor, a protective cage comprising a floor (4), two side walls (5, 6), and, on the front, a contact terminal with a matching male contact, the contact terminal comprising at least an elastic contact blade (8, 9) provided with a terminal part (10, 11) oriented towards the front of the contact, the side walls (5, 6) being laterally adjacent to the floor and folded back along a longitudinal axis, the elastic contact blade being made from a lamination connected to the rear of a side wall and extending before being folded towards the rear of the contact.","publicationDate":"2003","type":"PATENT","link":"http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?II=3&ND=3&adjacent=true&locale=fr_EP&FT=D&CC=FR&NR=2826785A1","source":null,"subtitle":null,"alternativeSummary":null,"linkDocument":null,"authors":null,"thesisDirectors":null,"identifiers":{"thesesfr":null,"patent":"FR-2826785"},"thematics":[{"type":"cib_35","code":"01","label":"Machines et appareils électriques, énergie électrique"},{"type":"cib_5","code":"D1","label":"Electronique, électricité"}],"structures":["349566240"]}]
